# Same Origin Policy (SOP)
SOP is a policy implemented by browsers to prevent interactions between resources of different origin

eg. Browsers check the SOP when performing AJAX requests. A script on domain1.com cannot access by means of an ajax request (XHR) for a page on domain2.com.

## see CORS
The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is used to 'relax' the restrictions imposed by SOP. If permits, the origin domain2.com allows access from origin domain1.com, the cross-origin XHR mentioned above example will succeed.

## crossdomain.xml
A script on origin `a.com` can access resources such as images/audio files on a different origin, `b.com` only if the `crossdomain.xml` file allows this operation
