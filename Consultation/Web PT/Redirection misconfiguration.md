# Description

- when an unauthenticated user requests protected contents, they may receive an HTTP response with header `Location: http://www......com/login` that redirects the user to a login page
- Sometimes there HTTP response may have 'body' infomation due to misconfiguration by developer to not terminate script execution after inserting the redirect statement

## defense
Terminate the script execution after redirection. Eg. in PHP after the redirection usually the instruction `die()` will be called to terminate the script execution, thus preventing the disclosure of the body data
