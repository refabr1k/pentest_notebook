# Description
Enabled client-side cross-origin requests

They are called `Control Access Headers`

CORS enable cross-origin requests for
- Ajax (through `XMLHttpRequest` API)
- Web Fonts (via `@font-face`)
- WebGL textures
- Images (using `drawImage` API)

## How Cross-origin requests works
There are 2 kinds of cross-origin requests
### 1. Simple request
- Uses only `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`
- if `POST` is used, `Content-Type` must be

```http
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
multipart/form-data
text/plain
```
- no custom http headers

### 2. Preflight request
- Anything else that are not like **Simple Request**  is a **preflight request**
- eg. Get request with a custom header 
- It works by sending 2 HTTP requests:
	- HTTP `OPTIONS` request to determine if request is safe by the webserver. Example, the first request to delete has header like

	```http
	OPTIONS /file.html HTTP/1.1
	..
	..
	Origin: http://my_original_page.com
	Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
	Access-Control-Request-Headers: Front-End-Https
	```

	- The following response shows that the DELETE is allowed
	```http
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	..
	..
	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://my_original_page.com
	Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
	Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Front-End-Https
	Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
	```



## Access control headers
These headers control how the browser treat cross origin requests:

```http
Access-Control-Allow Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
Access-Control-Allow-Headers
Access-Control-Allow-Methods
Access-Control-Max-Age
Access-Control-Expose-Headers
Origin
Access-Control-Request-Method
Access-Control-Request-Header
```
