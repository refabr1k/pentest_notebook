# .NET Request Validation Disabled

## Description
- ASP.NET feature that checks HTTP requests if they contain malicious content
- Request validation helps to prevent potential attacks by returning error "potentially dangerous value was detected" error

## Impact
- Exploits are typically cross-site scripting
- Allowing scripts to be rendered due to lack of validation

## Recommendation
Enabling in Web.config
```asp
<configuration>
<system.web>
	<pages validateRequest=”true” />
</system.web>
</configuration>

```




# Selective disabling request validation
In some cases you may need to accept input that will fail ASP.NET Request Validation, such as when receiving HTML mark-up from the end user. In these scenarios you should disable request validation for the smallest surface possible.

## ASP.NET Web Forms

### For ASP.NET v4.5 and before
You will need to disable request validation at the page level. Be aware that when doing this all input values (cookies, query string, form elements) handled by this page will not be validated by ASP.NET.

`<@ Page ValidateRequest="false" %>`

###  ASP.NET 4.5 and above
You can disable request validation at the individual server control level by setting
`ValidateRequestMode` to `Disabled`.

`<asp:TextBox ID="txtASPNet" ValidateRequestMode="Disabled" runat="server" />`
