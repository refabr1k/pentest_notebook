Network Taps

Network taps are a physical implant in which you physically tap between a cable, these techniques are commonly used by Threat Hunting/DFIR teams and red teams in an engagement to sniff and capture packets.

There are two primary means of tapping a wire. The first is by using hardware to tap the wire and intercept the traffic as it comes across, an example of this would be a vampire tap as pictured below.

Another option for planting a network tap would be an inline network tap, which you would plant between or 'inline' two network devices. The tap will replicate packets as they pass the tap. An example of this tap would be the very common Throwing Star LAN Tap
