what is osi model ? 
-open system interconnect.
-an open standard of requirements and framework for supporting interoperability between systems/softwares.
-Split into 7 abstract layers
-Each layer describes what and how data are broken down and transmitted from one end to anther


1. physical layer
-physical devices/cables/hubs
-represent the electrical, voltage, pin and other physical requirements
-data type are bits
-Examples: Coax, Fiber, Wireless, Hubs, Repeaters

2. data link
-handles error correction from the physical layer
-sublayer of this is the MAC and LLC. MAC provides identity of the communicating source, LLC provides the logic for data link such as synchronization, flow control and error checking functions.
-data type are Frames
-examples: Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge

3. network layer
-Routing functionality
-This layer allows packets to find their way to destinations
-routers to routers
-data type are Packets 
-examples: IP address, ICMP, IPSec, IGMP\

4. Transport layer
-Provide end to end connections
-Determine details like:
	how much data to send
	what transfer rates rates
	where does it go
-data types are TCP, UDP

5. Session layer
-At this layer, a session is created so that two computers or network device can speak with each other (such as continuously in conversation)
-functions such as timeout duration, how long to wait for response etc, how to terminate a session
-send to port
-data types are API, Sockets, WinSock

6. Presentation layer
-define how two devices should encode, encrypt, compress data
-prepares data from session layer to application layer (vice versa)
-examples are SSL, SSH, IMAP, FTP, MPEG, JPEG

7. Application layer
- end user software 
- provides protocols that allow software to send and receive info that are meaningful data to users 
-examples are web browsers, HTTP, FTP, Telnet
