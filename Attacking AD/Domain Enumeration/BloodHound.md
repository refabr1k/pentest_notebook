# Basics
- More useful for 'blueteamers' (based on personal opinion) vs redteamers
- Redteamers may find this tool to be 'too noisy' when stealth is required
- Provides a graphical representations of relationships between AD entities and relationships
- There are 2 components in Bloodhound
	1. Ingestors - collects data
		```powershell
		cd C:\AD\Tools\BloodHound-master\Ingestors
		. .\SharpHound.ps1
		
		(collect ALL)
		Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Verbose
		
		(Sometimes session data is missed out)
		Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod LoggedOn -Verbose
		# Compressing data to C:\............_BloodHound.zip
		# You can upload this file directly to UI
		```
	2. GUI - upload collected data and run various queries on it
		```powershell
		cd C:\AD\Tools\BloodHound-win32-x64
		BloodHound.exe
		# need to install neo4j
		# extract files to C:\neo4j
		# cmd as admin > cd C:\neo4j\neo4j-community-4.1.1\bin
