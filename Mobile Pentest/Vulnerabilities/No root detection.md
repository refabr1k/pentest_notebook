No checks if device is rooted
Rooting a device gives administrative privileges to the whole device

Normally android apps work in isolated environements (eg. sandboxes) meaning to say cannot gain access to other apps or system, but an app with superuser access can venture out of its isolated environmenet and take full control over the device.

- Private information used by the app could be at risk

# Recommendation
- Follow technical recommendations to deteect rooted andoird device And prevent rooted device from using app.
