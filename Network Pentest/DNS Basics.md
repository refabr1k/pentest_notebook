# What is DNS?
Domain Name System.

- It is a phonebook of the internet.
- service for translating domain names to IP address. 
eg. When you navigates to www.coolwebsite.com, what happens behind the scenes is a lookup request is sent to the DNS and finds what is the IP of www.coolwebsite.com and then navigating there


# 4 types of DNS servers when loading a webpage

1. DNS recursor - librarian fronting the client (person who makes the "lookup request". Librarian finds a particular book somewhere in the library)

2. Root nameserver - Like an Index in a library that points to different racks of books. 

3. TLD nameserver - top level domain server (TLD) is like the specific rack of books in library. in "example.com" the TLD server is "com"

4. Authoritative nameserver - the final nameserver. This is the last stop in the nameserver query. If the authoritative nameserver has access to the record, it will return the IP address of the requested hostname back to the DNS recursor (step 1)

# What are zone files
Zone files are a way for nameservers store information about domains they know about.
Eg. the more zone files a zone server has, the more requests it will be able to answer authoritatively.

## TTL (time to live)
Configures the 'time to live' of the information it provides.


## Record types
Within each zone file there are many different record types

- SOA (start of authority) - Every zone file must have this. 
	- Describe if there is a Primary/Secondary nameserver
	- Serial number of zone file (incremented after editing, e.g. bigger number = most updated)
	- interval of refresh - time for secondary dns before polling for primary changes
	- expiry period
- A and AAAA - A is used to map a host to IPv4, AAAA = IPv6 address
- CNAME - alias for caconical name. For example, A name record defining "server1" host and then use "www" as an alias for this host.
- MX records - mail exchanges used for the domain. (Note there is a number tagged to this record, the lower the number = higher priority)
- NS records - Name servers that are used for the zone. Typically at least 2 name servers defined in each zone file. So that if one has problem, the other is referred to.
- PTR records - Inverse of A or AAAA. PTR records provide the domain name in the PTR record of an ip address. Typically used for log entries and make informed easy-to-read details about services.
- CAA records - Specific why  Certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue SSL/TLS certes for domain. If no record are present, any CA may issue a cert.
