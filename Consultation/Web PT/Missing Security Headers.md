# Missing security headers
## x frame options 
- tells browsers whether they are allowed to render page in html elements like `<frame> <iframe>` 

- Used for protection against attacks such as click-jacking

## Strict transport security
- Lesser protection against attacks like protocol downgading. XSS

- Tells the browser that it should never load a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempt to access site using HTTP instead of HTTPS

- Protect against sensitive information being sent in cleartext

## CSP 
- Added layer of security to mitigate attacks such as cross site scripting attacks

- whitelisting of where resources can be loaded from. 

- Controled by the "script-src" directives. Dont use wild cards and dont use "usafe-eval"


## (x-permitted-cross-domain-policies)
without this header there may not be control or protection to limit where we can load resources (maybe malicious)
