# Missing security headers
https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/

## X-Frame-Options 
- tells browsers whether they are allowed to render page in html elements like `<frame> <iframe>` 
- Used for protection against attacks such as click-jacking
- There are 2 different values:
	- `DENY` - the recommended value to prevent resources to be shown inside an iframe from any container's origin.
	-`SAME ORIGIN` - document may be shown inside an iframe only if the container page (under control of attacker) share the same origin.


## Strict transport security
- Lesser protection against attacks like protocol downgading. XSS
- Tells the browser that it should never load a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempt to access site using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Protect against sensitive information being sent in cleartext

## Content-Security-Policy
- Added layer of security to mitigate attacks such as cross site scripting attacks
- whitelisting of where resources can be loaded from. 
- Controled by the "script-src" directives. Dont use wild cards and dont use "usafe-eval"
- good idea to use google's csp evaluator https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/

```javascript
           
// For example:  script like this 
<script>
	doSomething();
<script>

// unsafe-inline allows all of the JavaScript event handlers to execute, for example code like this:
<button onClick="doSomething();">Do It</button>**
```

-   `'unsafe-eval'` allows the application to use the `eval()` JavaScript function. This reduces the protection against certain types of DOM-based XSS bugs, but makes it easier to adopt CSP. If your application doesn't use `eval()`, you can remove this keyword and have a safer policy.

## X-XSS-Protection
OWASP said its deprecated and not required.

The X-XSS-Protection header has been deprecated by modern browsers and its use can introduce additional security issues on the client side. As such, it is recommended to set the header as `X-XSS-Protection: 0` in order to disable the XSS Auditor, and not allow it to take the default behavior of the browser handling the response. Please use `Content-Security-Policy` instead.

## X-Content-Type-Options
- Prevents MIME-sniffing attack
- If MIME-sniffing is allowed, MIME sniffing allows web browser to "sniff" and determine what file type (for eg. during file upload)
- Which can be exploited eg. uploading .png files but with PHP code content.
- Recommended to defined "nosniff" which prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response

## x-permitted-cross-domain-policies
without this header there may not be control or protection to limit where we can load resources (maybe malicious)
