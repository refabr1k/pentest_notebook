# Description
Is an attack where attacker fixates a `sessionID` and forces victim to use it, allowing an attacker to gain access to the same session after the user logs in.

1. Attacker obtains a valid `sessionID`
2. Attacker forces the victim to use this `sessionID` to establish a personal session with the web server

# How to detect
- Session identifier remains the same after a successfully reserved operation eg. login
- Session identifier can be propagated eg. via URL or Javascript

# Remediation
- Consider generating new Session IDs after any authenticated operation is performed. 
- Sessions should also not be able to be accessed directly by any unauthenticated users.
- Several server-side scripting language provide different libraries and built in functions to manage sessions:
