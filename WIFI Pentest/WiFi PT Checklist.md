| 1 | Encryption | WEP/ WPA1 | [x] Unsafe! Broken! | 
|  |  | WPA2 PSK | [x] This is an issue if Corporate is using this instead of Enterprise. Mainly due to: <br> (1) Shared password - any user's password being compromise means that the network will be accessed by the attacker. <br> (2) Attacker can capture client-AP handshakes, these handshakes can be cracked offline especially if weak or commonly known passwords are used. | 
|  |  | WPA2 Enterprise | refer to [[../EAP Types]] | 
| 2 | Windows Setting | "Validate Server Certificate" enabled? | [x] |
| 2 | | “Do not prompt user to authorize new servers or trusted certificate authorities" enabled?| [x] |
| 3 | Authenticated checks | Client provide login to router to check configurations |  | 
| | | Monitor, log and evaluate traffic using Airodump-ng and Wireshark
| |  | Look out for transmission of sensitive information like user credentials or any vulnerable protocols in use |  | 
| |  | Do a quick network scan, and run detailed scans on significant hosts such as proxies, internal file servers or the APs themselves |  | 
| |  | Spend some time on the AP, typically there is a web management portal that can be interesting |  | 
| |  | Network Segregation - Check to ensure that at a minimum the Guest, Internal, Wired networks are all segregated e.g ping host clients using guest clients |  | 
| |  | Guest WiFi - If there is a captive portal, see if it is possible to bypass it. If the Guest WiFi is understood to restrict internet access, do verify this |  | 
| |  | Check issued certificates, weak hashing algorithm, etc. |  | 
| 4 | Authentication protocol | Using encapsulated EAP protocols such as |  | 
| |  | EAP-TLS (certificate based on both client-server) |  | 
| |  | EAP-TTLS (use server side only certs) |  | 
| |  | PEAP |  | 
| 5 | Check if WPS is in use | Use airodump-ng with --wps to check |  | 
| 6 | Rogue AP Detection | Verified by plugging into any available LAN ports on the AP. Check to ensure that the AP is not directly connected to the client’s corporate networks  (guest/wireless/internal/wired) |  | 
| 7 | Physical location check | If they are physically easily accessible, take some photographs as evidence |  | 
| 8 | Evil Twin AP | Info gathering on channel, encryption, protocol |  | 
| |  | Setup rogue AP (hostapd-mana) |  | 
| |  | (optional) Setup fakedns, phishing page, responder |  | 
| |  | Deauth client successfully |  | 
| |  | Device connected to rogue AP |  | 
| |  | (optional) victim use browser to trigger payload for capture NTLM v1/v2 hash |  |
