# What?
log4j is a loggin framework that allows developers to log data within their application. it is part of the apache software foundation, used widely by many notable organisations and applications we know today. The primary purpose of log4j is for logging information which can be use for debugging

the vulnerability CVE2021-44228 affects apache log4j 2 versions 2.0 to 2.1.4.1. The severity rating was assigned as CVSS 10 which is the maximum due to its easy to exploit and wide attack surface nature. An unauthenticated user can exploit this by simply inserting some strings (such as an attacker controlled server which contain a malicious program) and send the request to a victim server to perform remote code execution.

# How?
The issue lies in that apache log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups. Which can be exploited when an attacker who can control logging parameter, inserts a string reference to tell JNDI lookup an attacker controlled location, loading the malicious program.

What are JNDI - Java Naming and Directory interface allows applications to lookup services in an abstract and resource-independent way.
