      

 - Install a certificate signed by an internal CA that is trusted by all wireless users on the RADIUS server.

- Avoid using RADIUS certificates signed by public CAs.

- Enforce validation of RADIUS certificates and manually select the internal CA to be trusted. Do this centrally, via tools like Active Directory Wireless Group Policies if possible. Ensure help-desk personnel and users are not capable of modifying this configuration since it has a way of becoming disabled when people are troubleshooting wireless issues.


# Weak PEAP client config
      

PEAP-TLS is a specific wifi authentification scheme. It use an external server, called authenticator, to validate the authentication of clients. The authentication mechanism use CHAPv2 algorithm which is vulnerable to an offline password cracking attack if an attacker is able intercept the traffic.

In order to protect against this attack PEAP-TLS implement a SSL layer during the authentication time.

A weak client configuration could afford attackers to set up a fake access point to make client use the wake access point instead of the real one. The weak configuration is related to the fact the client accept any certificate given by the authenticator server.

It is recommended to register the CA certificate of your authenticator server in your client laptop.
