 # Improper Input Validation
 

Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from persisting in the database and triggering malfunction of various downstream components. It is always recommended to prevent attacks as early as possible in the processing of the user's (attacker's) request. Input validation can be used to detect unauthorized input before it is processed by the application.

The findings were raised as firstname and lastname are typically expected to be strings, so the inclusion of special characters can present a risk where the values are malformed for downstream components. We also observed that inputs were saved and this indicates that the data may have been persisted in the backend (eg. database) along with arbitrary inputs such as special characters.

Consider following OWASP recommendations as seen in [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html) where OWASP mentioned that

_Input validation should be applied on both syntactical and Semantic level._

**_Syntactic_** _validation should enforce correct syntax of structured fields (e.g. SSN, date, currency symbol)._

**_Semantic_** _validation should enforce correctness of their values in the specific business context (e.g. start date is before end date, price is within expected range)._
