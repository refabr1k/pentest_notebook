# Description
IDOR happens when objects can be accessed directly by using user-supplied inputs (eg. by using an identifier, ID number)

# Impact
An authenticated user able to access other user's resources.

# Recommendation
- Each protected page must contain a prologue - Prologue is a block of code written in server-side scripting language to determine if users are authorized to access the resources. In cases when they are not, terminate script execution and prevent the unauthorized access from happening

## example prologue in PHP
```php
<?
	session_start();
	if (!isset($_SESSION['logged'])){
		header("Location: http://www.homepage.com/login");
		die();
	}
?>

```

-  Provide access controls checks
- Identifiers used should not be predictable and random (its predictable if the ID increases in sequential order)
