# Domain Enumeration - Defense
- Hardening can be done on the DC (or other machines) to contain the information provided by the queried machine
- Monitor any spikes in network traffic (events 4624 and 4634) 

## Using Netcease script
```powershell
# mitigate enumeration
.\NetCease.ps1

#restart service
Restart-Service -Name Server -Force

# revert
.\NetCease.ps1 -Revert
```

**Note**: It May break stuff when this script is run, do test out in enterprise settings.
- Netcease is a script which changes permissions on the NetSessionEnum method by removing permissions for Authenticated Users group.
- This fails many attacker's session enumeration and hence user hunting capabiities



## Using SAMRi10 script
- Hardens windows 10 and Server 2016 against enumeration which uses SAMR protocol (like net.exe)
