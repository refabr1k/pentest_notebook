# Find all machines on current domain that has local admin access
Looks for all machine on current domain where current user has local admin access

NOTE:
- Can be quite noisy as it is looking at every single machine if they are localadmin.
- Run this in batches and not in bulk as it is very noisy (raises chances of detection)
- Function raises 4624 (logon event) 4634 (logoff event) in audit logs


```powershell
(1)
Find-LocalAdminAccess -Verbose
```

## How it works?
- Queries DC of current/provided domain for a list of computers `Get-NetComputer` 
- Use multi-threaded `Invoke-CheckLocalAdminAccess` on each machine.


# (alternatively) If RPC or SMB ports blocked

Consider using  `Find-WMILocalAdminAccess.ps1` by default needs local admin privileges. If this script runs successfully, it is a good indicator that the current user **has** local admin privileges
