# CVE vs CWE vs CAPEC 
CVE = Common Vulnerabilities and exposure
CWE = Common Weakness Enumeration
CAPEC = Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification


- CVS is a list of currently known issues regarding specific systems and products. 
- CWE categorizes type software vulnerabilities.
e.g **CWE-311 Missing encryption of sensitive data**
- CAPEC is a list of common methods attackers use to exploit weakness 
e.g. **CAPEC-37 (attacker can) retrieve embedded sensitive data**

## Pros
When used together CWE, CAPEC compliments each other well by providing understanding and guidance of preventing security vulnerabilities for all levels of personnels in regards to helping them build more secure software.


# CWE 

- Common language or baseline for identifying weakness.
- Provides knowlege for mitigation and prevention 

# CVE
- Publicly assigned ID that identifies a vulnerability affecting a system and products.
- Provides severity impact (eg. has CVSS), remediation steps
- References to security advisories provided by vendor
