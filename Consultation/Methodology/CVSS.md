# What is CVSS?

CVSS scoring is a framework used by security testers to measure severity of vulnerability discovered during a penetration test. CVSS 3.1 is the latest.

## CVSS 3.1 vs 3.0
Main differences between CVSS 3.1 and 3.0 is that the new version have improved the clarity of concepts introduced by CVSS v3.0 - improving the overall ease of use of the standard.


# How is CVSS calculated?
The Severity score is presented as Critcal, High, Medium, Low with numbering scoring formula calculated based on various factors

## Access 
How the exploit can be carried out eg. by public network, Internal network, local machine

## Complexity
Complexity of the exploit (eg. is the exploit easily accessible or widely circulated in public - if yes that would be considered 'Easy to exploit'. 

## Require user interaction
exploit can be carried out with some user interaction needed. or without (eg. zero click exploits)

## Require authentication
Only possible if login to web application

## CIA triad
Impact of vulnerability

- Confidentialiy - relates to the data at stake eg. password, secrets..
- Integrity - Integrity of data being affected eg. tampared data
- Availability - service availability, eg. Denial of service attacks
