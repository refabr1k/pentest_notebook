# Monitor and Reset Kerberos TGTs (twice!)

- Monitor for TGTs that exceed the default lifespan recommended for Active Directory: a maximum of 10 hours for a user ticket. 
- However, note that sophisticated attackers don’t set incredible ticket times. 
- Detections tied to these types of Mimikatz “default configuration” artifacts are unlikely to be presented by a more sophisticated adversary. 
- If you are alerted to a Golden Ticket on your network, you must **reset the KRBTGT service twice** : once to generate a new key and a second time to delete the compromised key.

# Prevent Attacks with Patching

- reinforcing security education awareness
- training about password reuse and phishing attacks
- conducting vigilant patch management

# Enforce User Least Privilege

- rely on a least-privilege model to restrict user and domain administrator access
- limit the number of administrator accounts



# Validate the Kerberos Protocol

- external validation of the Kerberos protocol is required to assure that every ticket presented by a Kerberos principal (i.e. service client) was in fact issued by a legitimate key distribution center.
