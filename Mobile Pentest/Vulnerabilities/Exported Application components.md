How to spot for "exported" components. Check AndroidManifest.xml

- Check if 'exported=true'
- Check if there is implicit export if there are `<intent-filter>` element it means it is exported.


# 4 types of components to take note of:
## Activities
If there are exported activities, you can access by using activitymanager

```
adb shell am start -n com.activity/.name

```


## Services

## Broadcast receivers

To perform some actions based on some Action events on the device


## Content providers

content providers acts as bridge between users and database eg. SMS. If there are contentproviders in androidmanifest.xml you can query using

```bash

content query --uri content://sms/inbox

```

# explicit exported

An "exported" activity, service, or content can be accessed by other apps. There are two common ways to designate a component as exported. The obvious one is setting the export tag to true `android:exported="true"`.

For example, this activity of yours probably has this `<intent-filter>`:

```xml
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
```

This says "hey, anything that is a launcher, please include me in your roster of launchable activities!". The launcher is how most Android device owners start apps. If your activity is not exported, then the launcher would not be able to start your activity, and as a result the user will not be able to use your app.

Note that having an `<intent-filter>` on an `<activity>` automatically sets `android:exported` to `true` — you do not need to declare this manually


# implicit exported



- check AndroidManifest.xml

- see if there are implicit 'export' see `<intent-filers>` if there are any permission sets. Below is an example:
	
	
```xml
<receiver android:name=".VulnerableReceiver">
	<intent-filter>
		<action android:name="com.elearnsecurity.vulnerablereceiver.CHANGEPW">
		</action>
	</intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

# Mitigation

1) Set the permission for the application or set the android:exported=false. 2) If you only intend to use exported components between related apps under your control, use android:protectionLevel=”signature” in the xml manifest to restrict access to applications signed by you.
