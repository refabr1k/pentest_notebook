# Description
- CORS allow the external site to load data from victim. 
- CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) usually used on API Website Application. 
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). 

Describe how CORS Misconfiguration Happens?

- The Misconfiguration CORS can be indicated when we send the Origin header on the request with our domain and reflect on the Web Application “Access-Control-Allow-Origin“ response header. 

		If the bypass can be reflected on the Access-Control-Allow-Origin more likely the website application is vulnerable and can be exploited

# Impact

- CSRF attacks
- We can trick the victim to click our CSRF form (on our website) it can load data from victim browser and steal data etc cookie etc

# Recommendations
The Website Application already implements the filter on Access-Control-Allow-Origin. So, only whitelist domain/subdomain will reflect on the headers. 

Great, now what should we do? Move to another vulnerability? Don’t so fast. Try to bypass the restriction. With this kind of try:

    whitelistdomain.com → whitelistdomain.com.attacker.com 

    whitelistdomain.com → whitelist-domain.com 

    whitelistdomain.com.sg → whitelistdomaincom.sg 


   - Always use the proper configuration of cross-domain requests. 
   - Only whitelist the trusted website on the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header. 
   - The origin should be properly specified in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
