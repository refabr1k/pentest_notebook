Invoke-UserHunter
Invoke-UserHunter -Verbose
Invoke-UserHunter -GroupName "RDPUsers"
```

Invoke-UserHunter -CheckAccess
```


# Find computers where a domain admin is logged-in
Query only high value targets instead of all machines.
```powershell

Invoke-UserHunter -Stealth

## What are sessions? and Why?
One to easiest way for privilege escalation to domain admin

- Look for machine where Domain Admin Token or credential (or session) is available
- And we also have Local Admin privileges on that particular machine too
- Using the Local Admin we have on that box, we can extract credentials (TGTS, NTLM hashes or AES keys etc) of Domain Admin


## How it works?
- Queries DC of current/provided domain for members of the given group (Domain Admins by default) using `Get-NetGroupMember`
- Get a list of computers `Get-NetComputer`
- Get lists sessions and logged on users using `Get-NetSession/Get-NetLoggedon` from each machine
