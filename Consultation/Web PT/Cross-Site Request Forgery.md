# Description
Third-party web application is able to perform an action on the user's behalf. For an instance, a web application affected by CSRF allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by making the web app send requests to other web application.

1. Bob (victim) -logins-> Amazon.com (without logging out)
2. Bob -> evil.com (attacker controlled) -> executes a malicious request to Amazon.com from Bob's browser (eg. buy a book)
3. Victim browser sends this request along with victim cookies. The request seems legit to amazon.com


# Counter measures
- CSRF token ( or nonce ) which is a number used once and discarded which makes part of the request to be performed unpredictable for an attacker
- While rendering the form to user, the following protects against CSRF. In this way, the POST request made will always be checked to ensure the token stored in session matches the token received. If theres a match, the request succeeds.
	- Generate a token
	- Include token as hidden input on the form
	- Save the token in the session variables
