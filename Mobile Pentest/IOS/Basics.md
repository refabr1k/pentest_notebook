```bash

#list files in .app folder and categorize them to types. Tips: save into a file and grep the file types eg. plist 
$ find . -type f -exec file -- {} + | less -S

#list all functions and libraries used
rabin2 -l Payload/MyApp.app/MyApp | less

#view plist in xml format
plistutil -i Info.plist -f xml
```
