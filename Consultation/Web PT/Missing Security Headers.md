# Missing security headers
https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/

## X-frame-options 
- tells browsers whether they are allowed to render page in html elements like `<frame> <iframe>` 
- Used for protection against attacks such as click-jacking

## Strict transport security
- Lesser protection against attacks like protocol downgading. XSS
- Tells the browser that it should never load a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempt to access site using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Protect against sensitive information being sent in cleartext

## Content-Security-Policy
- Added layer of security to mitigate attacks such as cross site scripting attacks
- whitelisting of where resources can be loaded from. 
- Controled by the "script-src" directives. Dont use wild cards and dont use "usafe-eval"
- good idea to use google's csp evaluator https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/

## X-XSS-Protection
OWASP said its deprecated and not required.

The X-XSS-Protection header has been deprecated by modern browsers and its use can introduce additional security issues on the client side. As such, it is recommended to set the header as `X-XSS-Protection: 0` in order to disable the XSS Auditor, and not allow it to take the default behavior of the browser handling the response. Please use `Content-Security-Policy` instead.

## (x-permitted-cross-domain-policies)
without this header there may not be control or protection to limit where we can load resources (maybe malicious)
