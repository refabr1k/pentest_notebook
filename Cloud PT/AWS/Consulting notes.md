# What will you be doing
- Scanning for misconfig?
- over permissive policies 
	- inline policies - attached to IAM users
	- trust relationships - which principals can assume role
- permission boundaries - setting maximum permissions for specific users to control and prevent privesc

# Shared Responsibility Model

- Security in the cloud is tested, **not security of the cloud.**
- security of the cloud - managed by CSP, infrastructure

- security in the cloud, vendor and customer data, OS, network, 

## Methodology

- IAM enumeration 
	- In real world scenario, we may not have access IAM service to view policies for actions/resources
	- Perform Bruteforce is to 
		- (1) test which API is accessible
		- (2) which permission this user has. 
		Note: Since we do not have access to IAM service in this case, we will not be able to know if the permission is controled by IAM or SCP.
