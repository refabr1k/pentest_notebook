# Description
- Password remember feature can be implemented through
# 1. Browser cache
THe following code enables browser to cache password
`INPUT TYPE="password" AUTOCOMPLETE="on"`

## defense
to instruct the browser not to store and cache for HTML password element use
`INPUT TYPE="password" AUTOCOMPLETE="off"`

## 2. Storing credentials permanently within the **web storage**
Developer could rely on local storage to store credentials such as using API call `localStorage.setItem()` to add an item containing credential data to local web storage

## defense
- if cookie contain user password, password must be encypted before storing it within cookie
*Note: Cookie can still be stolen eg. via XSS exploit and installed on a different browser*

# 3. storing credentials within a cookie
Cookies to store credentials and sent through HTTP cookie header. A token may also be stored in cookie (which is a better feature) as token can be be given an expiration that can be shorter than expiration of the user's password.

The security concern here lies in that cookie could be stolen through (1) XSS - if cookie is not marked with `HTTPOnly` flag (2) Session hijacking via packet sniffing if cookie is sent over unencrypted channel `Secure flag`
