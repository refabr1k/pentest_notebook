# Find local admins on all machines of Domain 
Needs administrator privileges on non-DC machines

```powershell
Invoke-EnumerateLocalAdmin -Verbose
```

## How it works?
- Queries DC of current/provided domain for a list of computers `Get-NetComputer` 
- Use multi-threaded `Get-NetLocalGroup` on each machine.
