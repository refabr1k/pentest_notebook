The following headers sent by target origin tells the requester...

# Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Most important http response, whether to allow access from specific requester origin
```http
# Allow only from domain3.com
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: domain3.com

# Allowing all origins
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: **
```

# Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
if request can be made with credentials
```http
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```
Note: The following is not allowed when resource is accessible by any origin and it accepts credentials too
eg. setting `Access-control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` is **not** allowed.
