## Compilation process
1. `.java` files -> java compiler  `.class` 
2. `.class` files are then -> compiled to `.dex` (dalvik executable) along with third-party libraries  
3. `.dex` compled resources and other resources -> apkbuilder to produce a `.apk` file


## APK file structure
**AndroidManifest.xml**: the manifest file in binary XML format.

**classes.dex:** application code compiled in the dex format.

**resources.arsc:** file containing precompiled application resources, in binary XML.

**res/:** folder containing resources not compiled into resources.arsc

**assets/:** optional folder containing applications assets, which can be retrieved by AssetManager.

**lib/:** optional folder containing compiled code - i.e. native code libraries.

**META-INF/:** folder containing the MANIFEST.MF file, which stores meta data about the contents of the JAR. which sometimes will be store in a folder named original.The signature of the APK is also stored in this folder.

Every APK file includes an AndroidManifest.xml file which declares the application’s package name, version components and other metadata. Full detail of Android manifest specs file can be view here. Below is just some common attributes that can identify in AndroidManifest.

## Methodology

2. Reversing
3. Static Analysis
4. Dynamic Analysis
5. Reporting
