# OWASP Code Review Guide

## What is SCR?
- Identify vulnerabilities from perspective of security by design
- Identify security flaws in applications related to its features, design along with its root cause.
- Audit the source code to verify proper security and logical controls are present

## How SCR is performed?
- Combination of Human effort (Manual) and Technology support (Automated - tools driven). 


### Manual
- Manual review of source code for insecure coding patterns
- Follow OWASP security checklist to access application's
	- Data Validation
	- Authentication
	- Session Management
	- Authorization
	- Cryptography
	- Error Handling
	- Logging
	- Security Confguration
	- Network Architecture
- Pros is that it is low in false positive
- Con is that time consuming ([1] MITRE statistics shows that a proficient reviewer can get through about 3,000 lines of code a day, based on the experiences of the MITRE Secure Code Review Practice

### Automated
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools analyze source code or
compiled versions of code to help find security flaws.
- Useful for things tools can find with high confidence like SQL injection flaws, Bufferoverflow
- Scales well - can run on lots of software and languages (with continuous integration)
- Output is good for developers - highlights the preceise source file, line numbers or even subsections of lines that are affected
- Pros all above
- Cons 
	- high number of false positives. 
	- Configuration issues such as cannot compile code or do not have the right libraries, so tools cannot analyze code accurately. 
	- Difficult to 'prove' identified security issue is an actual vulnerability

### Combining both approach
Combining both Automated and Manual as assessment approach would be most ideal as they compliment each other to offer a more accurate assessment.
