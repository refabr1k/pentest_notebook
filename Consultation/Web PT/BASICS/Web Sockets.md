# Web Sockets

- WebSocket protocol is **Full-duplex** - allows communications in both directions at same time
- Real TCP connections allow Low latency 
- No polling overhead

## Security  Issues
- WebSockets do not create security pitfalls per se
- If developers do not sanitize the contect of messages exchanged via WebSockets, they could be used to perform a variety of attacks such as XSS, localStorage stealing, SQL injections.
