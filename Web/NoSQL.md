# NoSQL databases
What are NoSQL databases? A NoSQL* (originally referring to "non SQL") database is a datastoring and data-retrieving system that is modeled differently than the tabular (and relations-based) relational databases. 

*It should be noted, that NoSQL databases are also sometimes called "Not only SQL", due to the fact that they may support SQL-like query languages.
