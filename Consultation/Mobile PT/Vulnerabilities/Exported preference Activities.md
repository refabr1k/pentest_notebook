An "exported" activity, service, or content can be accessed by other apps. There are two common ways to designate a component as exported. The obvious one is setting the export tag to true `android:exported="true"`.

For example, this activity of yours probably has this `<intent-filter>`:

```xml
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
```

This says "hey, anything that is a launcher, please include me in your roster of launchable activities!". The launcher is how most Android device owners start apps. If your activity is not exported, then the launcher would not be able to start your activity, and as a result the user will not be able to use your app.

Note that having an `<intent-filter>` on an `<activity>` automatically sets `android:exported` to `true` — you do not need to declare this manually

# Mitigation

1) Set the permission for the application or set the android:exported=false. 2) If you only intend to use exported components between related apps under your control, use android:protectionLevel=”signature” in the xml manifest to restrict access to applications signed by you.
